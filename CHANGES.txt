GIBBLER, CHANGES

#### 0.5.3 (2009-07-12) #################################

* FIXED: Updated gemspec to fix missing files (aliases)
* CHANGE: conversion to attic instead of weirdo instance 
  variables (@__gibbler__ and @__gibbler_history)
* NEW DEPENDENCY: attic


#### 0.5.2 (2009-07-07) #################################

* CHANGE: Moved Gibbler instance methods to Gibbler::Object
* ADDED: Proc.gibbler which is included by default
* ADDED: gibbler aliases to allow shorter methods by request.


#### 0.5.1 (2009-07-06) #################################

* CHANGE: Renamed gibbler_revert to gibbler_revert! (Thanks ivey)


#### 0.5 (2009-07-01) #################################

NOTE: This is a significant change from 0.4. Many method names  
have been modified so this release is not backwards compatible. 

* CHANGE: Now refer to "gibble" as "digest" in all docs and methods. 
* CHANGE: Gibbler#gibble -> Gibbler#gibbler
* CHANGE: Gibble is now Gibbler::Digest
* ADDED: Gibbler::History, supporting gibbler_snapshots and gibbler_revert
  for the following objects: Array, Hash
* ADDED: Support for short, 8-character digests
* ADDED: Expanded test coverage


#### 0.4 (2009-06-30) #################################

NOTE: Calculated digests have changed since 0.3. Most digests created with 
0.3 and earlier will not match those created in 0.4 for the same object

* FIXED: Hash and Array now use the class of the value for hashing
  rather than Hash or Array (respectively).
* FIXED: __gibbler methods now return a digest based on their own class. 
  Previously, all digests were created by String.__gibbler so the class
  name from the original object got lost. 
* CHANGE: Gibbler methods are no longer available to all Ruby classes
  by default. The default list is now: String, Hash, Array, Symbol, 
  Class, Fixnum, Bignum. 
* CHANGE: Renamed Gibbler.gibbler_digest_type to Gibbler.digest_type
* ADDED: Custom objects can now "include Gibbler::Complex"


#### 0.3 (2009-06-29) #################################

* CHANGE: Renamed to_gibble -> gibble
* CHANGE: Renamed __default_gibbler to __gibbler
* CHANGE: Created Gibbler module, all other modules can 
  include its junk into their namespace. 
* ADDED: Object#hash and performance tryouts


#### 0.2 (2009-06-25) #################################

NOTE: Initial release
