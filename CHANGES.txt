* CHANGE: Renamed gibbler_revert to gibbler_revert! (Thanks ivey)


#### 0.5 (2009-07-01) #################################

NOTE: This is a significant change from 0.4. Many method names  
have been modified so this release is not backwards compatible. 

* CHANGE: Now refer to "gibble" as "digest" in all docs and methods. 
* CHANGE: Gibbler#gibble -> Gibbler#gibbler
* CHANGE: Gibble is now Gibbler::Digest
* ADDED: Gibbler::History, supporting gibbler_snapshots and gibbler_revert
  for the following objects: Array, Hash
* ADDED: Support for short, 8-character digests
* ADDED: Expanded test coverage


#### 0.4 (2009-06-30) #################################

NOTE: Calculated digests have changed since 0.3. Most digests created with 
0.3 and earlier will not match those created in 0.4 for the same object

* FIXED: Hash and Array now use the class of the value for hashing
  rather than Hash or Array (respectively).
* FIXED: __gibbler methods now return a digest based on their own class. 
  Previously, all digests were created by String.__gibbler so the class
  name from the original object got lost. 
* CHANGE: Gibbler methods are no longer available to all Ruby classes
  by default. The default list is now: String, Hash, Array, Symbol, 
  Class, Fixnum, Bignum.
